    <h1>Twilight Verse</h1>
    <p>
    In twilight's gentle, fading hue<br>
    Whispers of the evening dew.<br>
    Stars adorn the velvet sky,<br>
    A cosmic dance, as time drifts by.<br>
    Moonlight weaves a silver thread,<br>
    Through dreams where fantasies are bred.<br>
    Nature's symphony, a soft refrain,<br>
    Echoes of a world untamed.<br>
    
    Blossoms bow in the pale moon's grace,<br>
    A tranquil night, a sacred space.<br>
    Silent symphony, a lullaby,<br>
    As the universe hums, oh so high.<br>
    
    Embrace the night, let worries wane,<br>
    In the celestial dance, find peace again.<br>
    A poem spun from twilight's art,
    A masterpiece written in the heart.<br>
